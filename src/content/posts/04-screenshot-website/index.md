## Overview

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` or `F12` to open the browser developer tools.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + M` to toggle the device toolbar.
3. Click the dots on top right and select "Add device pixel ratio" or DPR.

5. Set resolution (e.g. 512x512).
6. Select the HTML element you'd like to capture within the "elements panel".
7. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the run command interface.
8. Type "node" to show the "Capture node screenshot" and press `Enter`.
9. Enjoy your screenshot.

### 1. Open Developer Tools

### 3. Add Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)

Click the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the Developer Tools pane. From the dropdown menu, select **"Add device pixel ratio"** (or **DPR**).

### 4. Set Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)

In the Device Toolbar, set the DPR to **2.0** if it is not already set. This ensures the screenshot captures with the desired pixel density.

### 5. Set Resolution

In the Device Toolbar, set the desired resolution. This configures the viewport size for your screenshot.

### 6. Select HTML Element

In the Elements panel, navigate to and select the HTML element you want to capture. This highlights the specific node for the screenshot. Usually the `<body>` element will work, but it depends on the site you are screenshotting.

### 7. Open Command Menu

Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) to open the Command Menu in Developer Tools.

### 8. Capture Node Screenshot

In the Command Menu, type "node" to filter commands and select **"Capture node screenshot"** from the list. Press `Enter`.

### 9. Enjoy Your Screenshot

The screenshot of the selected HTML element with the specified DPR and resolution is now saved. You can find it in your default download location.
