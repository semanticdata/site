## ‚ìò Background

While searching for themes, I came across [Zola Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Sadly, the project's last update was on Dec, 2021. Shortly after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.

The name **Mabuya** comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct[^1] species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.

## ‚ú® Features and Improvements

While working on the theme, I have added new functionality and made many quality of life improvements. Here's a short list:

- ‚úÖ Refactored stylesheets.
- ‚úÖ Added Dark theme and color theme toggle.
- ‚úÖ Added new footer navigation.
- ‚úÖ Created a custom GitHub Action to deploy Zola sites faster than any other GitHub Actions using Docker.
- ‚úÖ Refined page transitions from desktop to mobile and viceversa.
- ‚úÖ Centralized custom variables‚Äìmade it easier to customize the site's colors.
- ‚úÖ Addressed PR [#7](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/pull/7) fixing the pagination problem present in the original Zola theme.
- ‚úÖ Addressed Issue [#4](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/4) fixing custom text not being used correctly.
- ‚úÖ Addressed (temporarily) Issue [#1](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/1) by removing the erroneous pinned marker.
- ‚úÖ Optimized for speed and accessibility. Subtle color changes to make the text more readable, etc.
- ‚úÖ Many other small improvements...
