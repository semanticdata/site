## â“˜ Background

While searching for themes, I came across [Zola Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Sadly, the project's last update was on Dec, 2021. Shortly after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.

The name **Mabuya** comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.
